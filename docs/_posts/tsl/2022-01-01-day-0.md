Gents,

This post is my first check-in of the new year. I'll be using this platform for my accountability for the Strenuous Games 2022. This year, I am part of two groups: TSL Chicago and TSL Garden State. I aim to be a better man by the end of the Strenuous Games and continue to be strenuous for the rest of the year. These aims include:

* One hour of strenuous activity each day,
* One good deed each day,
* Completing the *agon* each week,
* Working towards badge completion each month,
* Achieving my personal goals each quarter,
* Holding myself accountable to you fine men with every action I undertake.

I will start by outlining some personal goals for Quarter 1, 2022.

**Every Sunday, I will go 5 miles with 20 lbs in my rucksack**. That starts tomorrow for me. Looking out the window here in Chicago, there are six inches of snow. But, that is no excuse for not going out--there is no such thing as bad weather. I rucked last winter in freezing conditions and mounting snow. These are some of my most incredible memories of 2021.

**I will update this personal blog every day**. I hope that you will join me in my blethering and rumblings. I am an amateur programmer, better than a novice but far from an expert in the topic. Last year I programmed every day without missing two days in a row for over six months. I missed three days over that time, and I consider those black marks on my record. This blog is an extension of that daily dedication to constant improvement.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for another update later today.
