## Week 2 Day 6

Back-to-back meetings today from 9 am until 4 pm. I had most of the handover for the contracts and leads, part of the role. There is still a shitload to learn on the job, and I feel like the deep end is a good teacher. Moving to a new apartment tomorrow; will likely be kept busy for a few days with that. Buying lots of things the last few days has not been fun. I'm tired this evening, so I'll keep the rest short.

### Physical Culture
> Living the Strenuous Life requires committing to one hour of physical activity each day.

Yoga and walking.


### Skill Development
> Living the Strenuous Life requires dedication to constant skill acquisition and practice.

Nothing outrageous today.

### Moral Discipline
> Living the Strenuous Life requires forging my moral discipline and seeking to do good deeds every day.

I met a friend over lunch at the establishment next door.

### The Agon
**Week 2**
> Bookend each day with a 90-minute morning and evening routine.

I'll be glad to see the bookend of this agonâ€”what a drag.
