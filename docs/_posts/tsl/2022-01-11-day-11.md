## Week 2 Day 4

This evening I made the Weekly Accountability Call with TSL NJ. On the call were McCall C, Dan D, and Fernando. It was great to catch up with everyone, and I always feel motivated to go and do hard things. This week my I hold myself accountable to complete the following:

1. Code every day.
2. Blog every day.
3. Work out one hour every day.
4. Self-improve for one hour every day
5. Do one good deed every day.
6. Ruck for at least a 5-mile with at least 20 lbs on Sunday.
7. Ruck for 10-miles total this week.
8. Get to bed by 10 pm and up by 6 am next week.

There is a lot of overlap with my personal goals for Stren Games, but I want to be responsible for my accomplishments over the six weeks, and those guys are part of the process as I am part of theirs. 

### Physical Culture
> Living the Strenuous Life requires committing to one hour of physical activity each day.

I did an early morning ruck inspired by Josh C and his beastly morning outings. I did nearly 2-miles in frigid weather. But, it was great to get out this morning, and I had some bragging right with my frozen mustache.

I did yoga this evening with my wifeâ€”11 days streak.

### Skill Development
> Living the Strenuous Life requires dedication to constant skill acquisition and practice.

Journaling and shaving continue every day. Updated my budget

### Moral Discipline
> Living the Strenuous Life requires forging my moral discipline and seeking to do good deeds every day.

What good did I do today?
I wished a friend good luck with some technical interviews this week.
I listened to a complex, personal problem from another friend.
I gave some advice on a startup idea.  

### The Agon
**Week 2**
> Bookend each day with a 90-minute morning and evening routine.

I don't believe it is helpful for me to provide exact times when these bookend activities start and end. My mornings, in particular, are dynamic. So instead, I will start the timer on the events to happen.
