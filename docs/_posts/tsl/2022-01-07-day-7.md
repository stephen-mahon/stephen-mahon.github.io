## Week 1 Day 7

Both boys woke up this evening for over an hour. My eldest has night terrors sometimes. He, unfortunately, woke my youngest. I took the youngest, and my wife took the oldest. She had the rough end of that bargain. This afternoon, I met a colleague, Lane Allen of [Allen & Pepa Architects](https://www.allenpepa.com/). I've been doing some consultancy work for Lane these past months on furniture design for a particular piece, an origami chair. We've had a good relationship, and I'm sorry I can do more work with him at the moment. I'm sure we'll work together again soon.

### Physical Culture
> Living the Strenuous Life requires committing to one hour of physical activity each day.

Bodyweight fitness in the late evening. [Reddit's recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) with the [basic app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bodyweight.fitness.free). I would appreciate suggestions for alternative bodyweight fitness applications.

Yoga in the evening. Seven days of yoga. May the streak continue!

### Skill Development
> Living the Strenuous Life requires dedication to constant skill acquisition and practice.

I am journaling, keeping on top of personal finance tracking, getting the lumber for the wood requirement of the craftsman badge.

### Moral Discipline
> Living the Strenuous Life requires forging my moral discipline and seeking to do good deeds every day.

I treated a colleague for lunch today. I've never had a [sope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sope_(food)) before.

### The Agon
**Week 1**
> Expose yourself to cold water (for at least 5 minutes) every day for seven days.

I feel like the end of Seven, but instead of Gweneth Paltrow's head in the box, it's five more weeks of cold showers.

Bring on Week 2 tomorrow!
