This year I'd like to increase my skill, agency, and autonomy and become more active rather than passive. A list of achievements, especially when reviewing the previous year, can look dismal if you don't plan and prepare in advance. Being patient pays off in the long term, so here is a list of some of the badges I'd like to complete this year:
* Backyard Farmer
* Craftsman
* Entrepreneurship
* Gearhead
* Hacker
* Infosec
* Journaling
* Letter Writing
* Personal Finance
* Salesmanship
* Scholar
* Shaving

This list is ambitious, but twelve badges correspond with twelve months. Some of the badges I have experience with, for example, I did the 31-day journal challenge way before joining the Strenuous Life. However, I will start most of these badge requirements from scratch. Below are some details and motivations for each badge.

## Backyard Farmer Badge
I've been a vegetarian since early 2016. It is primarily out of a combination of environmental and animal welfare reasons. Industrial agriculture is certainly no saint when it comes to environmental agency, and I often worry about the footprint of each item of food I eat. The workers who pick the food often labor in harsh conditions for minimal pay. I want to experience more self-sufficiency with my grown food and taste the fruits of my labor. I also believe it will be a valuable learning experience for my children to understand that while food grows on trees, it doesn't just arrive on our plates.

My park district offers allotments for very little money. They come in a variety of sizes to suit beginner farmers. The season here in the Midwest won't start until the Spring, so I have some time to plan for this. My fine fellow, Mike Wieczorek from the TSL New Jersey Chapter, has kindly offered advice and ideas.

## Craftsman Badge
My fellow TSL'r from the Chicago Chapter, David Stopps, talked recently about the difference between a novice and a craftsman. We discussed, briefly, being limited by the tool. While the discussion was about rapid prototyping tooling like 3D-Printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, with which I have considerable experience, I began to think about my journey through crafting since leaving grad school.
I went to a technical middle-high school to provide all the skills to become a successful apprentice. For a while, that was what I geared myself. But life happened, and I chose another path. I am fortunate to be part of a maker community with fully functioning wood, metal, and fabric workshops. The space provides the equipment for obtaining all the requirements for the badge and the expertise to create crafts of extremely high quality.
Last year I read the required reading for this badge: Peter Korn's beautiful book [Why We Make Things and Why it Matters](https://godine.com/book/why-we-make-things-and-why-it-matters/) and the insightful Art of Manliness article Measure Twice, Cut Once. I made a desk for my office and a fire piston as a novel fire starting method. The desk is fantastic, and I use it every day. The fire piston, however, needed more work. I will do three more projects this year with the excellent facilities provided by [Fox.Build](https://fox.build).

## Entrepreneurship Badge
I would describe myself as entrepreneurial. I have started businesses and have failed. It comes easy to me for some reason, but I have never quite found success in my endeavors. I have created several side-hustles in the last year to tide me over while searching for a job. I freelance CAD design, buy and resell books on Amazon, and design websites for clients. CAD design has netted me the most money and has the highest input from me. Website design is similar because you are on-call for any problems or queries from clients. Book flipping, however, has more potential for the least amount of input. My colleague Dev Man Dan helped crunch the numbers with me over a Taco Tuesday last week. It certainly looks promising, and I will keep you updated here as I progress towards a $1000 profit over the next year.

## Gearhead Badge
OK, here it goes: I have never learned to drive and have never owned a car. I never had to! I lived in a city until last year when I immigrated to the US. Now my job is remote, and driving is not a priority. My wife drives us places when needed in my Mother-in-law's car when she is not using it (we live with my parents-in-law for a couple of more weeks). We inherited a car before Christmas. Now is an excellent time to learn the basics of car ownership and mechanics, and sometime this year, I will learn how to drive.

## InfoSec Badge
Online security is paramount in this day in age. I spend most of my days online, and who knows where my valuable information is stored. So it is of extreme importance that we protect our private information from malicious characters; some of the requirements may be outdated, but I am willing to follow through.

## Hacker Badge
I'm not sure this is a proper name for this badge. A hacker has a nefarious meaning to it, and this badge certainly is far from breaking encryption protocols on your neighbor's WiFi router. While I am competent in several programming languages, I will do this badge to complete the challenge. I took the Python course on Codecademy in 2015, the SQL course last year and have designed projects on an Arduino in the past. I will level up these requirements to my standard for this badge - build a website from the ground up and launch on a custom server from a Raspberry Pi or some equivalent.

## Journaling
I enjoy writing and want to capture my thoughts and ideas for prosperity. We are the sum of our experiences, and the man I will be in the future will be different from the man I am today. Journaling is a route to understanding who I am now for who I will be later. I will be journaling electronically using the free software Obsidian, which uses markdown for formatting, similar to how I use this blog.

## Letter Writing Badge
Writing a letter, to me, is the most daunting badge on this list. It is personal, challenging, and requires much time composing, editing, and sending out correspondences. We live in a digital age where we expect reactions and responses within minutes. The dopamine hit from a notification alert has turned us into animals awaiting a treat. Letter writing looks to be the antidote to the crushing digital dependency of this dystopian world. I was reminded yesterday by my fine fellow and friend, Luis Fernando Pareja-Roman, Ph.D., of the inscription carved in marble at the post office.
> Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.

## Personal Finance Badge
I am good with money, but I was not always so. I was constantly overdrawn on my accounts and credit cards in my college days, which drew anxiety each time I looked at my bank account. I am a [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) enthusiast and can say, with no hyperbole, that no other piece of software has had more of a profound and positive impact on my life. As I transition into the working world and away from the academic ivory towers I have spent more than ten years, I must make more long terms and lay the foundation of financial security and success.

## Salesmanship Badge
I recently got a job in technical sales: spectrometers for analytical sciences. I made sales in cell phones in a past life when I left school. The work was meaningless, and I wanted a more fulfilling career. It's interesting that after ten years of further education, including graduate studies, I had gone back to what I started when I wanted to make changes. My colleague Ethan Ide convinced me that a career in technical sales would suit my skill set. I had the impression that salespeople were greasy and slimly individuals who'd sell their grandparents to make a commission. How wrong I was. Sales, especially in the technical area, is more problem-solving than imagined. Nobody wants an item they do not need. And the matching of expectations to reality is an essential skill for any man in this day. I want to complete this badge to cement and advance my career.

## Scholar Badge
I value learning, and learning will be doing for the rest of my life. Currently, I am auditing a class on [Molecular Spectroscopy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/spectroscopy) from the University of Manchester on Coursera. Last year, I introduced machine learning, four modules in project management, and the [Go Core Language learning path](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/go-core-language) from Pluralsight. I will continue to learn with or without this badge.

## Shaving Badge
Rituals in my life are essential. They make up what is me and my day. I want to be more mindful of the daily actions and chores and respect the everyday activities. The more abstracted we are from the task, the less aware we become of the action. Shaving is a crucial example. Electric razors give a fast and adequate result if used daily. I am sure who decided that we, as men, do tasks as quickly as possible and with the least effort possible. I believe that we act less mindful in the above way. We must be present and aware of who we are and what we are doing. Else we will be overcome with unexpected and unsettling thoughts and feelings about ourselves. While acting with mindfulness does not hide or obfuscate what we indeed are, we focus on being intensely aware of what we are sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. This badge may be the most critical badge on my list.
