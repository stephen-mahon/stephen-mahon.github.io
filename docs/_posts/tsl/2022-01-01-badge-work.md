This year I'd like to increase my skill, agency and autonomy and become more active rather than passive.
A list at the end of the year can look dismal if you don't plan and prepare in advance.
Being patient pays off in the long term so here are a list of some of the badges I'd like to complete this year:
* Backyard Farmer
* Craftsman
* Entrepreneurship
* Gearhead
* Hacker
* Infosec
* Journaling
* Letter Writing
* Personal Finance
* Salesmanship
* Scholar
* Shaving

An ambitious list, but twelve badges to correspond with twelve month of the year.
Some of the badges I have experience with, for example I did the 31-day journal challenge way before I joined the Strenuous Life, and last year I built a desk.
However, I will be starting the majority of these badge requirement from scratch.
Below are some details and motivations for each badge.

## Backyard Farmer Badge
I've been vegatarian since early 2016.
It is mostly out of a combination of environmental and animal welfare reasons.
Industrial agriculture is certainly no saint when it comes to envirnomental agency and I often worry about the footprint of each item of food I eat.
The workers who pick the food often labor in harsh conditions for mininal pay.
Each ounce of food is paved with backbreaking work.
I would like to experience more self-sufficiency with my own grown food and taste the fruits of my labor.
I also believe it will be a valuable learning experience for my children to understand that while food grows on trees, it doesn;t just arrive on our plates.

My park district offers allotments for very little money.
They come in a variety of sizes to suit beginner farmers.
The season here in the Midwest won't start until the Spring so I have some time to plan for this.
My fine fellow, Mike Wieczorek from the TSL New Jersey Chapter, has kindly offered advice and ideas and I will gladly take.

## Craftsman Badge
My fellow TSL'r from the Chicago Chapter, David Stopps, talked recently about the difference between a novice and a craftsman.
We discussed, briefly, about being limited by the tool.
While the discussion was about rapid prototyping tooling like 3D-Printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, of which I have a considerable experinece with, I began to think about my own journey through crafting since leaving grad school.

I went to a technical middle-high school aimed at providing all the skills to become a successful apprentice.
For a while that was what I gear myself towards.
But life happened and I chose another path,
I am fortunate to be part of a maker community with a fully functioning wood, metal, and fabric workshops.
Not only does this provide the equipment for obtaining all the requirements for the badge, but also the expertise to creating crafts of extremely high quality.

Last year I read the required reading for this badge: Peter Korn's beautiful book [Why We Make Things and Why it Matters](https://godine.com/book/why-we-make-things-and-why-it-matters/), and the insightful AoM article [Measure Twice, Cut Once](https://art-of-manliness.tumblr.com/post/54568074012/measure-twice-cut-once-applying-the-ethos-of-the).
I made a desk for my office, and a fire piston as a novel firestarting method.
The desk is awesome and I use it every day.
The fire piston, however, needed more work.
I will make three more projects this year with the generous facilities provided by [Fox.Build](https://fox.build).

## Entrepreneurship Badge
I would describe myself as enrepreneurial.
I have started businesses and have failed.
It comes easy to me for some reason, but I have never quite found success from me endevors.
I have started several side-hustles in the last year to tie me over while searching for a job.
I do freelance CAD design, I buy and resell books on Amazon, and I design websites for clients.
CAD design has netted me the most money but also has the highest input from me.
Website design is similar because you are basically on-call for any problems or queries from clients.
Book flipping however has more potential for the least ammount of input.
My colleague [Dev Man Dan](https://devmandan.com/) helped crunch the numbers with me over a Taco Tuesday last week.
It certainly look promising and I will keep you updated here as I progress towards $1000 profit over the next year.

## Gearhead Badge
OK, here it goes: I have never learned to drive and have never owned a car.
I never had to!
I lived in a city until last year when I immigrated to the US.
Now my job is remote and driving is not a priority for me.
My wife drives us places when needed in my Mother-in-law's car when she is not using it (we are living with my parents-in-law for a couple of more weeks).
My wife's father bought a new car just before Christmas and we have inherited his old car once we can change the deed.
Now is a good time to learn the basics of car ownership and mechanics, and Ssme time this year I will learn how to drive.

## InfoSec Badge
Online security is paramount this day in age.
I spend most of my days online and my valuable information is often stored in vunrable places.
It is of extreme importance tha we protect our private information from odious characters,
Some of the requirements may be outdated but I am willing to follow through and see is my information security can be improved.

## Hacker Badge
I'm not sure this is a suitable name for this badge.
A hacker has a nefarious meaning to it and this badge certainly is far from breaking encryption protocols on your neighbors WiFi router.
Seriously, while I am competent several programming languages, I will do this badge for the sake of completion of the challenge.
I took the Python course on Codeacedmy in 2015, the SQL course last year, and have designed projects on an arduino in the past.
I will level up these requirements to my own standard for this badge - build a website from the ground up and launching on a custom server from an Raspberry Pi, or something.

## Journaling
I enjoy writing and want to capture some of mu thoughts and ideas for prosperity.
We are the sum of our experiences and the man I will be in the future will be different from the man I am today.
Journaling is a route to understanding who I am now for who I will be later.
I will be journaling electronically using the free software [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which uses markdown for formatting, similar to how I use this blog.

## Letter Writing Badge
Writing a letter, to me, is the most daunting badge on this list.
It is personal, difficult, and requires much time to compose, edit, and sent out correspondences.
We live in a digital age where we expect reactions and responses within minutes.
The dopamine hit from a notificaiton alert has turned us into animals awaiting a treat.
Letter writing looks to be the antedote to the crushing digital dependencey of this distopian world.
I was reminded yesterday by my fine fellow and friend, Luis Fernando Pareja-Roman, PhD, of the inscription carved in marble at the post office
> Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.

## Personal Finance Badge
I am good with money, but I was not always so.
In my college days I would constantly be overdrawn on my accounts and credit cards and it drew anxity each time I looked at my bank account.
I am an [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) enthusiast and can say, with no hyperbole, that no other piece of software has had more of a profound and positive impact on my life.
As I transistion into the working world and away from the acadamic ivory towers for which I have spent more than 10 year, I must make more long terms and lay the foundation of financal security and success.

## Salesmanship Badge
I recently got a job in technical sale: spectrometers for analytical sciences.
I did sales in cell phones in a past life when I left school.
The work was meaningless and I wanted to me more fullfilled with my career.
It's interesting that after 10 years further eduction including graduate studies that I have gone back to what I started when I wanted to make changes.
My colleage Ethan Ide convince me that a career in technical sales would be suitable to my skill set.
I had the impression that salespeole were greasy and slimley individuals who'd sell their own granparents to make a commission.
How wrong I was.
Sales, espicially in the technical area is more problem solving than I imaginged.
No body wants to be sold an item they do not need.
And the matching of expecations to reality is an important skill for any man in this day.
I want to complete this badge to cement and advance my career.

## Scholar Badge
I value learning.
This is something I will be doing for the rest of my life.
Taking online classes is a hobby of mine.
Currently I am auditing a class on Molecular Spectrocopy from the University of Manchester on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/spectroscopy).
Last year I took introduction to machine learning, four modules in project management, and the Go Core Language learning path from [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/go-core-language).
I will continue to learn with or without this badge.

## Shaving Badge
Riturals in my life are important.
They make up what is me and my day.
I want to be more mindful of the daily actions and chores and give respect to the everyday actions.
The more abstracted we are from the task the less mindful we become of the action.
Shaving is a key example.
Electric razors give a fast and adquate result if used daily.
I am sure when it was decided that we, as men, do tasks as quickly as possible and with the least effort possible.
I believe that we act less mindful in the above way.
We must be present and aware of who we are and what we are doing.
Else we will be overcome with unexpected and unsettling thoughts and feelings about ourselves.
While acting with mindfulness does not hide or obfuscate what we truly are, we focus on being intensely aware of what we are sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment.
This may be the most important badge on my list.
