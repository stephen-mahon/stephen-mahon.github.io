## Week 1 Day 2
Today I started my other personal goal for this quarter: at least a five-mile ruck with 20 lbs in my rucksack. We had snow yesterday for most of the day and the temperatures throughout the day and night. So for my first ruck of the year, I knew what to expect: long underwear, a T-shirt, a flannel shirt, a thick sweater, wool socks, Bean boots, good quality jacket, gloves, and a stocking hat. I got up later than I wanted (more on that in an upcoming post), closer to seven with the kids. The kids ate breakfast; I had coffee. I am convinced there is some time dilation in the mornings; minutes pass in my head, and hours pass on the clock. I got out just after nine, and I was pissed. I get jealous of others' fresh tracks in the snow before me, for some reason. I believe that the path belongs to me, no one else. There is ego at play here that could manifest into something I don't want overtime. It is best to recognize and be aware of this emotion but not become overwhelmed.

### Physical Culture
> Living the Strenuous Life requires committing to one hour of physical activity each day.

The ruck was 5.5 miles over 1:45. The snow made for tough treading for good portions of the activityâ€”20 lbs added to the effort and the blisters on both heels after two miles. Fun and strenuous in 18F weather.

I also did 30 minutes of yoga with Adriene's [2022 30-Day Yoga Journey](https://youtu.be/Pmlh6AHFW0E). This activity is fun because I do it next to my wife in the evenings after the kids go to bed.

### Skill Development
> Living the Strenuous Life requires dedication to constant skill acquisition and practice.

#### Journaling
I am day two into the [31-day journaling challenge](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/jumpstart-your-journaling-a-31-day-challenge/). Today's topic was on the notion of manliness and what it means to me. I read the prompt this morning which provided fodder for my day today. I tackled my answer this evening after my cold shower.

#### Hacker
I also started the [Learn HTML course on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html). Here is my [Codecademy Profile](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Stephen_T). I took some classes on Youtube from [Colt Steele in March 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF_Xl5TOGlY&list=PLblA84xge2_xNtaFnZhefjFbnDrpySKD3), and he covered some CSS HTML in his videos. Back then, the government told us to isolate for two weeks, and the pandemic would be over.
I'll likely make progress on the course every day and knock it out quick enough. I am also aware of the absurdity of designing and coding websites while using my hosted website to post my accountabilities for this task.

#### Personal Finance
I updated the budget and linked my accounts on [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) yesterday. Some unexpected bills already not accounted for: the DMV for the deed change and new plates, about $300. Rule Three of YNAB is to roll with the punches, so I reassigned money from other categories to cover the costs. Rule two if YNAB is to embrace expenses, and I've set an annual goal for the cost of new plates.

#### Shaving
I shave every day after my cold shower. My setup is:
* [A plastic Wilkinson Sword Double Edge Razor](https://www.amazon.com/Wilkinson-Sword-Classic-Double-Razor/dp/B0012Y1FCK)
* [Van Der Hagen Double Edge Steel Razor Blades (made in Germany)](https://www.target.com/p/van-der-hagen-double-edge-steel-razor-blades-5ct/-/A-15704508)
* [Proraso Shaving Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Proraso-Shaving-Cream-Refreshing-Toning/dp/B00837ZOI0)
* [Porter's Badger Shaving Brush](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00019DODU)
* [Nivea For Men Sensitive Moisturiser](https://www.amazon.com/Nivea-For-Men-Sensitive-Moisturiser/dp/B000SQN74M)

### Moral Discipline
> Living the Strenuous Life requires forging my moral discipline and seeking to do good deeds every day.

This morning I got up with the kids and left my wife to sleep a little longer. I did some chores around the house and made her coffee when she got up. After my ruck, I made us egg tacos for lunch. 

### The Agon
**Week 1**
> Expose yourself to cold water (for at least 5 minutes) every day for seven days.

Yes, after yoga. I washed under the water today rather than just standing yesterday. Afterward, I got the water in the sink hot-hot my shave.

I am going to work on checking my ego for this journey.
