I am an award-winning researcher interested in robotics, fluidic and mechanical systems, electronics, rapid prototyping, robotics, spectroscopy, programming, machine learning, and computational physics.
I have a Bachelor of Science in Physics from University College Cork in Ireland and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Engineering from the University of Edinburgh. 
I am a Green Card holder and an Irish and a British Citizen–I am eligible to work in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States without sponsorship.
