## Week 3 Day 5

My coffee ritual this week:

* [Trader Joe's Dark Coffee](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/trader-joes-dark-coffee)
* An [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/)
* An electric kettle
* [A manual coffee grinder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B092MDTGGR/)
* [A good mug](https://www.amazon.com/Creuset-Stoneware-12-Ounce-Cerise-Cherry/dp/B003F24D1M/)

About 12g of coffee beans per 250 ml of water works well for me. I go with a fine grind but on the coarse side of espresso. For my hand grinder, that's 14 clicks. Hand crank while the water boils-it takes me about 90 seconds. The temperature of my boiled water is 200 F (90 C). I only use one filter and make sure that there is an even layer of grounds. 250 ml of water is halfway between the three and four mark on my AeroPress, but use a scale. Set the timer and push the plunger down maybe a 1/4" and retract 1/8" to create a suction in the chamber. Remove the apparatus from the scale! When two minutes are up, plunge slowly using only the weight of your arm. Drink black and enjoy.

## Physical Culture
> Living the Strenuous Life requires committing to one hour of physical activity each day.

I walked to work today and included a trip back home for lunch. I am taking advantage of the new digs close to work. Overall, the two round trips were 5.5 miles and took me a little over an hour in total. The weather was cold today, 15 F and dropping as the day dragged on. In the evening, I did 30 minutes of yoga.


### Skill Development
> Living the Strenuous Life requires dedication to constant skill acquisition and practice.

I continued with the [AWS Data Science Course](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/learning-path-data-scientist/) in Machine Learning. Unfortunately, I am not proficient in Python, so I will be doing the course in my preferred language instead: Go. However, I am 25% through the first module already.

### Moral Discipline
> Living the Strenuous Life requires forging my moral discipline and seeking to do good deeds every day.

I wrote an email to a [small content creator](https://www.youtube.com/c/NicTaylorWoodworking) on YouTube I enjoy. He does woodworking projects using the old methods. Check out his content, especially the series on his timber frame workshop.


### The Agon
**Week 3**
> Take the Army Ground Forces Test.

Friday, alright?
