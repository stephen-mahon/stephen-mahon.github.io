## Week 3 Day 6

Do less, but better.

## Physical Culture
> Living the Strenuous Life requires committing to one hour of physical activity each day.

5.5 miles today. 20 minutes of yoga


### Skill Development
> Living the Strenuous Life requires dedication to constant skill acquisition and practice.

I'm twenty days into journalling, twenty days into shaving with a badger brush and a double edge blade every day, tracking my expenses every day, and programming and coding every day.

### Moral Discipline
> Living the Strenuous Life requires forging my moral discipline and seeking to do good deeds every day.

After work, I made dinner and cleaned up the kitchen.

### The Agon
**Week 3**
> Take the Army Ground Forces Test.

Tomorrow, you hear?
