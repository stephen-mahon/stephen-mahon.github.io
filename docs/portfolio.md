## Connect-R
*Giant Industrial and Hydraulic Robots for Hazardous Environments*
![](/media/)
The Connect-R project aimed to address challenges in hazardous environments, focusing on nuclear settings. The robot had to self-assemble and provide access to inaccessible work sites.
### Responsibilities
* Prototyping for derisking in the proof-of-concept and ideation stage.
* Development of control mechanisms for radioactive environments.
* Invention of fluidic-based systems inspired by graduate work.
### Achievements
* I devised control mechanisms for hazardous environments where traditional electronics fail.
* I developed innovative fluidic systems for self-assembly and operation in radioactive settings.
* I addressed challenges like lifting heavy objects and processing large volumes of liquids.

## Technology: Fluidic Logic
Based on my postgraduate work, Fluidic Logic Ltd. is a startup that advances fluidic solutions through innovative design and manufacturing processes. The company has received support from The University of Edinburgh, mainly through the NxNw ICURe programme, and has leveraged technology from the InnovateUK Connect-R project.

### Core Capabilities
*Design for Manufacture of Fluidic Solutions*
* I crafted fluidic designs optimized for scalable manufacturing processes.
* I prioritized functionality, cost-effectiveness, and mass production suitability in every design endeavor.

*Intellectual Property (IP) Cores – Design Library and Swift Architectural Innovation*
*I developed proprietary IP cores to form a comprehensive design library for fluidic systems.
* Novel architectures allowed for the customization of fluidic solutions to meet unique requirements.

*Full-Stack Fluidic Design Automation Tools*
I pioneered fluidic design automation tools covering the entire design spectrum.
My work empowers intelligent fluidic machines' swift and efficient development, spanning diverse applications from biotechnology to wearable technologies and industrial robotics.

### Achievements
During the startup phase, I received significant assistance from The University of Edinburgh and the InnovateUK Connect-R initiative. By adopting Fluidic Design Automation tools, I was able to explore innovative possibilities in the field of fluidic machine development. Integrating IP cores into my design workflows has resulted in streamlined processes and the creation of novel fluidic architectures.

### Future Prospects
I envision Fluidic Logic Ltd. playing a pivotal role in shaping the next era of intelligent fluidic machines with diverse applications, ranging from biotechnology to industrial robotics. I left the company in 2021 when I immigrated to the United States for personal reasons.

## Microfluidic Bubble Dislodgement
This was part of some academic work for a research group at the University of Edinburgh.
The group was investigating bubble dislodgment and pressure distribution in microfluidic networks. The group wanted to use the silicone PDMS but had no experience with molding.
I designed and fabricated test structures under some tight tolerances: 800 375 um diameter pillars with 200 um spacing between pillars.
I designed the test structure on Fusion 360 and used the CAM function to generate the G-Code tool path for a Roland MODELA MDX-50 Benchtop Milling Machine.
Then I designed a  molding box for silicone molding and provided the prototype to the group.
Unfortunately, the research work was not continued by the group.

## RoboSoft Seoul, South Korea 2019
As part of my Ph.D. work, I designed pneumatic circuits for robots
The pneumatic circuits are equivalent to electronic circuits with pressure as voltage, flowrate as current, and the pressure and flowrate related by the hydraulic resistance of the circuit, a function of the sidewall friction, the channel dimensions, and the geometry of the circuit.
I designed test structures for measuring pressure/flowrate curves and designed a fluidic transistor.
I moved from transistors to a logic gate, to sequential logic, to memory elements in the circuit with a state machine to describe the behavior model of the system.
All the circuits were designed in Fusion 360 and manufactured on a CNC machine -- Roland Modela MDX-20, a desktop CNC milling machine.
The circuits were "sandwiched" together with routing on both sides of an acrylic sheet and vias for routing between layers.
The work has since been taken on by a Ph.D. student making fluidic design automation tools.
I presented my work at the IEEE Internation Conference on Soft Robotics 2019, Seoul S. Korea where I won the most outstanding student paper.
