## Connect-R
The brief of this project was a large industrial and hydraulic robot capable of self-assembly and provide access to work-sites in hazardous environments. In our case we were interested in nuclear environments with the following challenges:
* Hazardous working environments requiring protective equipment and limited time windows for operation
* Limited access through which to deploy the systems
* Unstable structures present that prevent occupation
* Lifting of heavy objects (~50kg) that require mechanical assistance
* Processing of large volumes of liquids (1000s litres)

Part of my role was the prototyping for derisking in the proof-of-concept and ideation stage of the project.
We brainstormed ideas for how the robot would behave and assemble.
My main role was to develop to control mechanisms for use in radioactive environments, a place were, traditionally, electronics do not work.
I invented new fluid controlled based systems based on my PhD work.

## Fluidic Logic
Fluidic Logic is about enabling the design and control of complex fluidic systems without the use of onboard electronics.
The technology is based on my Ph.D. work and postdoctoral work in robotic for extreme environments.
I took the pneumatic and hydraulic equivalent of a transistor and mover through abstraction from logic gates to sequential logic, memory, and instruction sets to encode a state machine for an electronic free system.
Some of the work is with a patent office submitted in March 2021.

## Microfluidic Bubble Dislodgement
This was part of some academic work for a research group at the University of Edinburgh.
The group was investigating bubble dislodgment and pressure distribution in microfluidic networks. The group wanted to use the silicone PDMS but had no experience with molding.
I designed and fabricated test structures under some tight tolerances: 800 375 um diameter pillars with 200 um spacing between pillars.
I designed the test structure on Fusion 360 and used the CAM function to generate the G-Code tool path for a Roland MODELA MDX-50 Benchtop Milling Machine.
Then I designed a  molding box for silicone molding and provided the prototype to the group.
Unfortunately, the research work was not continued by the group.

## RoboSoft Seoul, South Korea 2019
As part of my Ph.D. work, I designed pneumatic circuits for robots
The pneumatic circuits are equivalent to electronic circuits with pressure as voltage, flowrate as current, and the pressure and flowrate related by the hydraulic resistance of the circuit, a function of the sidewall friction, the channel dimensions, and the geometry of the circuit.
I designed test structures for measuring pressure/flowrate curves and designed a fluidic transistor.
I moved from transistors to a logic gate, to sequential logic, to memory elements in the circuit with a state machine to describe the behavior model of the system.
All the circuits were designed in Fusion 360 and manufactured on a CNC machine -- Roland Modela MDX-20, a desktop CNC milling machine.
The circuits were "sandwiched" together with routing on both sides of an acrylic sheet and vias for routing between layers.
The work has since been taken on by a Ph.D. student making fluidic design automation tools.
I presented my work at the IEEE Internation Conference on Soft Robotics 2019, Seoul S. Korea where I won the most outstanding student paper.
