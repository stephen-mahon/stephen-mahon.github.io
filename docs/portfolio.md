## [Fluidic Logic](https://fluidiclogic.com/)

_Enabling Smart Fluidic Machines_

`Oct 2020 – Mar 2021`

### Brief

Fluidic Logic Ltd. is a startup that advances fluidic solutions through innovative design and manufacturing processes. The technology enables rapid manufacture-ready designs for fluidic machines: microfluidics for biotechnology, soft robotics for wearable technologies, and hydraulic control systems for industrial robotics. The company has received support from The University of Edinburgh, mainly through the NxNw ICURe programme, and has leveraged technology from the InnovateUK Connect-R project.

### Methods

Based on my postgraduate work, I designed fluidic modules on **Fusion 360** and **OpenSCAD** and lab-tested extensively for functionality. I optimised manufacturing processes for scalability with **CNC machining**, **silicone moulding**, and **vector stencilling**. The prioritisation for every design endeavour was functionality, cost-effectiveness, and mass production suitability.

### Results

I developed proprietary IP cores to form a comprehensive design library for fluidic systems. Novel architectures allowed for the customisation of fluidic solutions to meet unique requirements. I pioneered **Full-Stack Fluidic Design Automation Tools** covering the entire design spectrum. In 2020, Fluidic Logic was awarded Innovate UK ICURe funding and formed as a spin-out startup of the University of Edinburgh.

_Industrial-Scale Self Building Modular Robotic Solutions_

`Jun 2019 – Oct 2020`

### Brief

The Connect-R project aimed to execute sophisticated tasks, such as building structures and deploying tools for inspection, lifting, and cutting, in hazardous environments like nuclear decommissioning, oil and gas mining, and space. In these environments, there is a significant risk to the health and safety of manual workers. As part of the Innovate UK Grand Challenges for Robotics in Extreme Environments, the Connect-R team developed an industrial-scale, self-building, and modular robotic solution to access work sites in these hazardous environments.

### Challenge 1:

Develop a systems interface based on the Robotic Operating System (ROS).

### Methods

First, I controlled a simple task using addressing and communication. ROS handled the communications for a hydraulic robot through a Programmable Logic Controller. Then, I moved from the test bench to a prototype system and outlined the system's requirements.

In this ROS/PLC prototype, the four actuators represent a robotic system.
The prototype was **Designed For Manufacture** using off-the-shelf hydraulic components, standard steel rods, and 2.5 mm of steel **Sheet-Metal** plasma cut and bent into place for minimal machining.

### Results

We ran simulations in our test environment and documented all the work, which was ultimately published in the peer-reviewed journal [Advanced Intelligent Systems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aisy.202000227). Much of the manufacture came to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the team delivered a working prototype of the [Connect-R Super Structure Moving Scaffolding](https://vimeo.com/569411483/25a3c2331d) using the ROS interface to Innovate UK to complete the project.

### Challenge 2:

Design and prototype a new control system for large-scale hydraulic machines using an experimental electronic-free scheme.

Electronic systems and components fail in extreme conditions like nuclear, space, and deep sea. These components must be heavily protected against the ionising effects of radiation exposure or the crushing pressure on the ocean depths. My solution was to remove the electronic components and replace them with a robust fluid-based circuit design.

### Methods

I demonstrated digital operations similar to those in electronics in hydraulics, such as binary operations to make a latch--a single-bit storage element for volatile memory.
I designed a circuit to remove the need for each hydraulic actuator to have a separate control line: m actuators, log2(m) select lines (e.g. 64 actuators can be controlled with eight lines). I built a demo system system using off-the-shelf components. I designed and manufactured a small-scale prototype spool-valve using **Rapid Prototyping** methods.

### Results

The prototypes and inventions for a [fluidic-based control system for hydraulic robots](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2022248836A1) were patented in 2021. The spin-out Fluidic Logic was established out of Edinburgh Innovation, the Technology Transfer Office of the University of Edinburgh.

_Removing Electronic Control_

`Sep 2018 – Apr 2019`

### Brief

I participated in the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics in Seoul, South Korea, showcasing pneumatic circuits for robots as part of my postgraduate work.

### Methods

Pneumatic circuits are like electronic circuits with pressure as voltage and flow rate as current. Sidewall friction, channel dimensions, and circuit geometry determine the hydraulic resistance. I designed test structures and a fluidic transistor, then progressed to logic gates, sequential logic, and memory elements.
I manufactured these circuits using **Rapid Prototyping** techniques such as **laser cutting**, **3D Printing**, **Silicone Moulding**, and I collected data with **pressure sensors**, **Arduino**, and **timing circuits**. The data were analysed using **Python** in **Panda**.

### Results

I showed that we can design pneumatic circuits like electronic circuits in soft robotics. I was invited to present my work at the IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics 2019. I was awarded the Winner of the Most Outstanding Student Paper award. The [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8722755/) has been cited dozens of times as the most highly cited presentation paper of the conference.

## [Origami Furniture Design](https://www.origami-lane.com/)

_Red Oak Zen Lotus Chair_

`Dec 2021 – Feb 2022`

### Brief

I collaborated with Lane Allen, AIA, LEED AP, BD&C, on the **CAD** and **CAE** aspects of his unique [Origami furniture](https://www.origami-lane.com/collections) designs, mainly focusing on "folding" wood.

<img src="../assets/portfolio/lane-allen.png" alt="drawing" width="675"/>

### Methods

Lane Allen's Zen-Lotus chair project involved drafting a unique folded chair from a single piece of 4'x8'x ½" plywood cut into three pieces and assembled into its 3D form. The project required expertise in CAD and CAE to bring Lane's vision to life.
I utilised **Fusion 360** for **3D drafting** of Origami chair designs.
I worked closely with Lane Allen to understand the metamorphic process exhibited in Origami. I ensured the CAD designs accurately represented Lane's vision before the orthogonal drafting phase.

### Results

I applied CAD expertise to translate Origami concepts into tangible, permanent chair forms. I worked alongside Lane Allen's team, including CNC experts and shop rebuild specialists. The Zen-Lotus chair is available to custom order through [Allen's website](https://www.origami-lane.com/collections/red-oak-zen-windsor-chair).
